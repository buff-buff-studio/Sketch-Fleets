<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a first semester interdisciplinary project, for PUC Minas Jogos Digitais (Game Engineering) course. It is a video game built with Unity, using assets and code created by the team, unless otherwise noted. Sketch Fleets is a chaotic bullet-hell arcade game based on a space sketchbook given life, where you explore constellations of diverse and weird planets, facing foes and upgrading yourself along the way. You control a 'mothership', and must summon a fleet of minion ships to aid you in battle!

### Built With
Tank Wrecks and its assets were built using the following software:
* [Unity](https://unity.com/)
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
* [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)
* [Krita](https://krita.org)
* [Adobe Audition](https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html)
* [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To download a working build of Sketch Fleets is simple; first check if your computer is running one of the supported OS and meets the requirements for CPU and GPU capabilities. Then, head over to the release pages, download the latest build, unzip the folder and open the game's executable. If you have any problems installing the game, feel free to open an issue or contact me at paulo at ninito.me for support.

### Minimum Requirements

You will need a working machine running:
* Windows 7 (SP1+) or later;
* Ubuntu 16.04 or later;
* Sierra 10.12+ or later;
* DX11 or later capable graphics card;
* A x86 or x64 architecture cpu

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## How To Play

In Sketch Fleets, you control a mothership on a 2D-sidescroller perspective. You can control the ship's movement using the WASD keys, and fire it with your mouse button. You can and should summon ships to aid you in your battle! You can do so by pressing spacebar and clicking on the color of the ship you want to spawn. Magenta ships fire alongside the mothership, cyan ships can throw themselves at the enemy to explode them, and yellow ships remain stationary while firing at the enemy. Your goal is to explore the planets and survive until the end!

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

The game is scheduled to release on June 12th, 2021. Until then, if you're interested in playing, grab a copy of one of the development builds! You'll probably find plenty of bugs and balance-pending content, but it'll be enough to scratch the itch. Plus, if you'd like to help us out, you can send feedback and bug reports on the builds.
