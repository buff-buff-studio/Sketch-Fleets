desc_ship_cyan=Look at it. Look at the sadistic glee it carries as it is thrown into its own death. I think we could all learn a thing or two from it.

desc_ship_pink=Ever wondered what a flak cannon that fires bouncy ball looks like? No? Well, the design team made this anyway. Don't blame me, I'm just the writer.
desc_ship_purple=Some strange weirdo Old One made these. They were evidently not very good at making things. Dear god, its so ugly!

desc_ship_yellow_enemy=Careful! Don't let it plug into an outlet or it it'll drain your phone's battery to charge itself! (And kill you, while its at it)

# ITEM DESCRIPTION

desc_armor_extra=When I said you should have more armor, I meant more but not this much. Jeez. Can you even handle that much? Decreases incoming damage.

desc_cursed_ammunition=Uhh... I think you might've made a blood pact or something... Your bullets ARE cursed but you're missing a few limbs. Increases damage, decreases health.
desc_cursed_propulsion=Wait... What? You decided to sell off one third of your vital essence for an extra pair of thrusters? You know what... Not such a bad idea. Increases speed, decreases health.
desc_fuel_tank_small=Enough fuel to get you through a galaxy or two. What is it made of? I don't know, something about liquefied puppies, never heard of it.  Increases speed.
desc_fuel_tank_large=Enough fuel to go to milky way and back! Not that you'd want to go there anyway... I heard there's humans over there. Gross. Greatly increases speed.
desc_mothership_dock_upgrade=Using dimensional (paper) folding tech, we can fit more ships in the hangar! Increases the maximum active summon count.
desc_mpencil_new=Ugh... The New Ones and their innovations - a mechanical pencil. Back in my day, we wrote with blood-soaked pointy bones. Increases max health significantly.
desc_mpencil_used=Not judging you but kinda judging you, you're pretty cheap. I mean, really? You couldn't be bothered to buy a new PENCIL? Wow. Increases max health slightly.
desc_pencil_average=Not too big, not too small. No shame about it. Heals instantly for 500 health.
desc_pencil_broken=If yours is bent like that, I would go to the hospital, but that's just me. Heals instantly for 250 health.
desc_pencil_perfect=Man, this one is pristine! Pretty big too! Wait - not in that way! Heals instantly for 750 health.
desc_pencil_sharpener=Built using the scraps of Excalibur's blade. You could use it to draw some pretty sharp things! Increases summon damage for 30 seconds!
