ui_tutorial_colors_title_0=Can I interest you in a TUTORIAL?
ui_tutorial_colors_desc_0=Ugh, sorry, I think I made it sound like I was offering you drugs there. Anyway, do you need any help? The cosmos is a dangerous place; wouldn't want to go out unprepared, would we?
ui_tutorial_colors_button_0_1=Sure, hook me up!
ui_tutorial_colors_button_0_2=Say no to Tutorials.

ui_tutorial_colors_title_1=How to CONTROL a Spaceship
ui_tutorial_colors_desc_1=MOVE by dragging your ship across the screen. AIM by dragging where your ship is shooting. If you're using JOYSTICK MODE, then just use the JOYSTICKS, dummy. Go ahead and DESTROY a ship to see if you've gotten the hang of it.
ui_tutorial_colors_button_1=Bloodlust, here I come!

ui_tutorial_colors_title_2=YES! YES! NOW PREPARE THE SUMMONING RITUAL WITH THEIR BLOOD!
ui_tutorial_colors_desc_2=Uh... I mean COLOR! Prepare the ritual with their COLOR. See the bar at the top? Those are the COLORS you've taken from your fallen enemies. You always gain the COLOR of the last enemy you DESTROYED. Use them to summon an ally!
ui_tutorial_colors_button_2=But... how?

ui_tutorial_colors_title_3=It's EASY! Tap that button!
ui_tutorial_colors_desc_3=Whenever you want to summon an ally with a COLOR, just tap the DRAW button on the center-bottom of the screen. It's the one with the arrow.
ui_tutorial_colors_pointer_3_1=Click on this button over here!

ui_tutorial_colors_title_4=Welcome to DRAW MODE
ui_tutorial_colors_desc_4=Now, use the color you've taken from your enemies to summon an ally. You can do so by drawing a shape. First, let's try a TRIANGLE.

ui_tutorial_colors_title_5=Welcome to DRAW MODE AGAIN!
ui_tutorial_colors_desc_5=Excellent job with the triangle. I would have made it a bit pointier, but still. Now, let's try something else. Draw a SQUARE!

ui_tutorial_colors_title_6=Welcome to DR- Yeah, you know.
ui_tutorial_colors_desc_6=That was a nice square! On to your last drawing lesson: Draw a CIRCLE!

ui_tutorial_colors_title_7=Now blow them up!
ui_tutorial_colors_desc_7=Circles make for nice bombs, don't they? Tap twice on the screen or press the bomb icon to throw yours.

ui_tutorial_colors_title_8=Great job! You've gone pro!
ui_tutorial_colors_desc_8=Or terrorist, since you've just thrown a bomb. But that's not important. You've got a whole galactic journey ahead of you! And now, you've got the skills too! Godspeed, my friend!
ui_tutorial_colors_button_8=Onwards I go!

ui_tutorial_map_title_1=Welcome to the Galaxy!
ui_tutorial_map_desc_1=This is the galaxy! Your goal is to explore planets until you reach the black hole at its center! Every time you begin a new game, your galaxy will be different. Some galaxies are short, others are long. Some are easy, others are hard!
ui_tutorial_map_button_1=Don't remember asking

ui_tutorial_map_title_2=Sure, but where do I go?
ui_tutorial_map_desc_2=Throughout your journey, you'll find a myriad different worlds. You should know some will be easier than others.
ui_tutorial_map_button_2=What's with all the park analogies?

ui_tutorial_map_planet_green=A walk in the park!
ui_tutorial_map_planet_orange=A walk in a park but the neighbors don't like you
ui_tutorial_map_planet_red=A walk in the park where a berserk Pit Bull is loose
ui_tutorial_map_planet_purple=A walk in the park but it's actually just pain

ui_tutorial_map_title_3=And what are these?
ui_tutorial_map_desc_3=Oh, yeah, and you'll find these too. Hoard as much money as Jeff Bezos and then visit a Shop planet. Or not. Its not like I'm your mom. There's also the Black Hole. Good luck with that.
ui_tutorial_map_button_3=Alright, let me go!

ui_tutorial_map_planet_yellow=A walk in the park but capitalism won so it's a shopping mall instead
ui_tutorial_map_planet_black=A walk in the park where reality itself is collapsing and the Old Ones have returned

ui_tutorial_codex_title=Were you ever addicted to trading cards?
ui_tutorial_codex_desc=No? You were addicted to actual drugs? Alright, I didn't expect that. Either way, this is where any collected trading card are going to show up. Here, you can read about the philosophically sophisticated lore of Sketch Fleets, its ships and its items.
ui_tutorial_codex_button=Gotta catch em all?

ui_tutorial_codexdrop_title=Oh, look, that's shiny!
ui_tutorial_codexdrop_desc=That right there is a Sketch Fleets trading card! Throw yourself at it like there's no tomorrow! Or not... It'll be collected whether you touch it not, no need to stress if you miss one. Visit the Trading Cards option in the menu to see your unlock!
ui_tutorial_codexdrop_button=GIMME! GIMME!

ui_tutorial_upgradeshop_title=Hold up! Only rich people past this point!
ui_tutorial_upgradeshop_desc=Whenever you conquer the Black Hole, any Pencil Shavings will be converted into full-on PENCIL BOXES! Awesome, I know. You can use your converted pencil boxes to buy powerful, permanent upgrades. In fact, there seems to be a 100% sale going on right now, why don't you grab a free sample?
ui_tutorial_upgradeshop_button=Sure, capitalist pig

ui_tutorial_shop_title_1=MONEY!
ui_tutorial_shop_desc_1=Welcome to the Seventh Sector's Eleventh Shop! You know those PENCIL SHAVINGS that make a nice 'pop' sound when you collect them? Well, you can spend them here to buy temporary items! (Or hoard them until the Black Hole to hopefully convert them into an even better currency!)
ui_tutorial_shop_button_1=You think I'm Mr.Krabs now?

ui_tutorial_shop_title_2=POOR CHOICE
ui_tutorial_shop_desc_2=No, truly, that's probably, like, the worst item in the game, by far. Ehh, whatever, It's not like you can't make use of it anyways. If it's a PASSIVE item, it'll automatically apply its benefits. If its an ACTIVE item, make sure to click on the BACKPACK icon in-game, and then click on the item itself twice to activate it!
ui_tutorial_shop_button_2=Whatever, captain obvious

# SHIP DESCRIPTIONS / CODEX
#

desc_ship_mother=The Mothership, an explorer of the cosmos unlike any other! It has seen countless worlds and destroyed countless foes! Truly the master of space!
desc_ship_magenta=Finger guns were the first firearms ever discovered in the universe. They were used by the Old Ones to enslave the New Ones, and make friends, of course!
desc_ship_cyan=Look at it. Look at the sadistic glee it carries as it is thrown into its own death. I think we could all learn a thing or two from it.
desc_ship_yellow=A friendly unidentified ship. You can't tell what it is, but it's friendly for sure! I think... Just don't let it speak to you in your dreams.

ship_blue=Icebox
ship_green=Pillfly
ship_orange=Napalm Bomb
ship_pink=Bouncy Boom
ship_purple=Ugly Thingy
ship_red=Sucker Punch
ship_yellow_enemy=Pluggy
ship_yellowplug_enemy=Fuse Box

desc_ship_blue=On a galaxy-wide quest to combat universal warming and fend off the inevitable heat death of the universe! Careful or it'll freeze you too!
desc_ship_green=You're sure to relapse any pill addiction you have when these guys show up! You'll literally brave gunfire for them!
desc_ship_orange=As if war crimes and violating the Geneva convention wasn't enough, these nasty things are also known for being space pirates!
desc_ship_pink=Ever wondered what a flak cannon that fires bouncy ball looks like? No? Well, the design team made this anyway. Don't blame me, I'm just the writer.
desc_ship_purple=Some strange weirdo Old One made these. They were evidently not very good at making things. Dear god, its so ugly!
desc_ship_red=The evil twin of the finger gun. Outlawed in most galactic empire jurisdictions, but still used by the young enemies of the Old Ones; the New Ones!
desc_ship_yellow_enemy=Careful! Don't let it plug into an outlet or it it'll drain your phone's battery to charge itself! (And kill you, while its at it)
desc_ship_yellowplug_enemy=Whatever electric engineer designed this thing definitely lost his permit. He also discovered the secret of animating objects, so I guess it balances out.
