desc_ship_cyan=Look at it. Look at the sadistic glee it carries as it is thrown into its own death. I think we could all learn a thing or two from it.

desc_ship_pink=Ever wondered what a flak cannon that fires bouncy ball looks like? No? Well, the design team made this anyway. Don't blame me, I'm just the writer.
desc_ship_purple=Some strange weirdo Old One made these. They were evidently not very good at making things. Dear god, its so ugly!

desc_ship_yellow_enemy=Careful! Don't let it plug into an outlet or it it'll drain your phone's battery to charge itself! (And kill you, while its at it)
