ui_tutorial_frog2=Follow these instructions, they will help on your space odyssey...
ui_tutorial_wasd=Use WASD or the arrow keys to move your ship
ui_tutorial_yellow=The yellow ship will remain stationary and fire five bullets forward in an arc. Place it wisely!
ui_tutorial_cyan=The cyan ship will orbit you until you use the right mouse button to throw it your enemies! If it hits them, it will deal lots of damage!
ui_tutorial_magenta=The magenta ship will orbit you and fire alongside the Mothership. They are your main source of damage, so summon them frequently!

ui_tutorial_store_planet=In your space odyssey, you will find yellow Store-Planets. There you can use Pencil Shavings to buy various items and upgrades that can be consumed or used during your odyssey.

# SHIP DESCRIPTIONS / CODEX
#

desc_ship_mother=The Mothership, an explorer of the cosmos unlike any other! It has seen countless worlds and destroyed countless foes! Truly the master of space!
desc_ship_magenta=Your trusty best friend, absolutely gunning everything down in your way, at your command!
desc_ship_cyan=The one ship you'll summon whenever you're sure you want something dead, and quickly!
desc_ship_yellow=Just set it and forget it - let it do the dirty work! Until an asteroid inevitably hits it, that is.

desc_ship_spinner=The huge lime bastard that makes you go 'Not this one again' every time it shows up. Well, when life give you limes, you destroy them with pencil tips!
desc_ship_shockwave=This one makes you wish life gave you limes instead of pain, but if you've got this card, it wasn't the case. Well, at least you got the card, right?
desc_ship_spire=Guaranteed to make you lose your cool every time it shows up. No exceptions. I mean - there's nowhere to go hide or go when these things start firing.

desc_ship_ace=The standard opposition throughout the cosmos! Slow fire rate, low damage, lots of purple! Not enough to kill you - not alone anyways!
desc_ship_skysplitter=The inventors of the Ace model noticed they weren't enough to kill you by themselves, so they made each Ace count for two! And now we have this.
desc_ship_starburst=A surreptitiously devilish version of the Ace, equipped with the magical ability of making you say 'Wait, what hit me?' every time.

desc_ship_seeker=The Seeker ship doesn't value its own life as much as it values your death! Destroy it before it reaches you - but you already know that.
desc_ship_destroyer=The Seeker's big, bad brother. Faster and more resilient. You probably went "Wait, why is this one faster?" the first time you saw one.
desc_ship_warfront=The Seeker's bigger, badder brother. Also the spaceship equivalent of a steamroller. Just hope there's enough space on the screen to avoid them!
